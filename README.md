This project analyzes customer data from an imaginary retail shop to understand how demographics and background factors influence spending behavior by using PostgreSQL. The goal is to create meaningful customer segments and provide insights that could be applied to marketing strategies, loyalty programs, and product targeting.

Dataset source: [Kaggle - Customers Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datascientistanna/customers-dataset)

## üóÇÔ∏è SQL Analysis Steps

1. **Preview Data**  
   - Check first 100 rows to understand dataset structure.  

2. **Check Data Quality**  
   - Verified unique `customer_id`.  
   - Found 35 missing `profession` values ‚Üí replaced with `'Unknown'`.  

3. **Customer Segmentation**  
   - Created a view `customer_segments` using **income** and **age groups**.  
   - Income segments: Low, Middle, High, Very High.  
   - Age groups: Gen Z, Millennial, Gen X, Boomer, Senior.  

4. **Spending Behavior Analysis**  
   - **Income + Age**:  
     - Young low-income customers show high spending potential despite small size ‚Üí suitable for referral campaigns.  
     - High/Very High income groups have large size but only moderate spending ‚Üí can be targeted with loyalty programs or premium offers.  
     - Middle/Low income older groups show low spending ‚Üí respond better to value-for-money products.  

   - **Income Only**:  
     - Very high-income group has the highest spending score with the largest customer base.  
     - Other groups have relatively close spending levels.  

   - **Age Only**:  
     - Spending decreases slightly with age.  
     - No significant outlier risk in these segments.  

   - **Profession**:  
     - Some variation (e.g., Entertainment & Artist higher than Homemaker & Unknown).  
     - Overall, profession does not strongly influence spending.  

   - **Family Size**:  
     - Spending is not significantly affected by family size.
       
   - **Gender**:
     - Spending is not significantly affected by gender.
